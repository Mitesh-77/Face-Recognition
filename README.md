# Face-Recognition

-->This project is use to Marks attendance  using face detection

-->In this project we propose an automated attendance management system. This system, which  is based on face detection and recognition algorithms, automatically detects the studentâ€™s face and  marks the attendance by recognizing him. 

-->The system  architecture and algorithms used in each stage are described in this project. Different real time  scenarios are considered to evaluate the performance of various face recognition systems.
